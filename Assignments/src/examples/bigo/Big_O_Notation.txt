1.  O(1); For each call to applyBreaks(), up to 2 operations will take place

2.  O(1); The loop will always run 10 times

3.  O(1); The loop will always run 10 times

4.  O(1); The inner loop will always run 3 times, and the outer loop will always run 4 times

5.  Impossible to determine; The only external input is System.getNanoTime(), which determines the seed. 

6.  O(1); There is only one operation

7.  O(1); There is no external input, so the program will always take the same amount of time.

8.  O(1); There is no external input

9.  O(1); There is no external input

10. O(1); There	is no external input
